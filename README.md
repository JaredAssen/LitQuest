SENG401: Team Final Project

## Group 29
## March 2023

LitQuest is a user based web application that allows users to write and view recommendations on books. It will act as a hub for readers to share their thoughts on books and will be the first place readers go before starting a new book. Users will be able to create their own profile, view all their reviews in a consolidated page, and add books to a personal library for easy tracking. Instead of having to search the web for sparse reviews, LitQuest will consolidate everyone's reviews on one page and display an overall rating for each book making LitQuest a user-friendly application for all users. Additionally, LitQuest will act as a personal reading guide, recommending books based on similar authors for users to enjoy. LitQuest will give book enthusiasts and new readers a platform to review and rate books.
